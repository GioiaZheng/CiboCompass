# CiboCompass (Human–Computer Interaction Project)

**CiboCompass** is a cross-platform mobile application developed as part of the **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at *Sapienza University of Rome*.  
The project focuses on **user-centered design**, **usability testing**, and **interaction principles**, implemented using **React Native** and **Expo Go**.

---

## 1. Overview

CiboCompass was designed to help **international students in Italy** better understand restaurant menus.  
The app enables users to browse dishes by nationality, check ingredients, calories, and dietary restrictions, and view global “like” percentages.  
It also allows users to submit feedback to improve personalization and recommendations.

The project applies **HCI principles** through iterative design, user research, and evaluation — including **surveys (Google Forms)**, **prototyping (Figma)**, and **usability testing**.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

- Apply **Human–Computer Interaction** principles in a real-world setting  
- Design a **user-friendly interface** for multicultural audiences  
- Conduct **usability testing** and analyze user feedback  
- Build a **cross-platform mobile app** using React Native  
- Evaluate accessibility and inclusiveness of the interface

## 5. Key Features

- 🌍 **Cultural Food Discovery** — browse traditional dishes from multiple countries  
- ⭐ **User Rating System** — rate and review each dish  
- 🥗 **Dietary Filters** — gluten-free and vegetarian options  
- 🧭 **Intuitive Navigation** — smooth scroll and easy country switching  
- 💬 **User Feedback Collection** — supports continuous usability improvement  

---

## 6. Design and Evaluation Process

1. **User Research** – collected data via Google Forms (20+ respondents)  
2. **Personas & Scenarios** – identified user needs (e.g., cultural adaptation, allergies)  
3. **Storyboarding** – visualized typical user interactions  
4. **Prototyping** – developed low- and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma  
5. **Implementation** – built using React Native and Expo Go  
6. **Usability Testing** – conducted heuristic evaluations and user testing rounds  
7. **Iteration** – refined UI and resolved issues related to scrolling, filters, and alerts

## 7. Installation and Run

### Step 1 — Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
````

### Step 2 — Start the Expo server

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code using the **Expo Go** app (available on Android and iOS) to preview the mobile interface.
